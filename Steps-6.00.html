<ol style="list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0.65em 0px 0.9em; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><strong>Solve the affordable housing crisis&nbsp;</strong>: The data indicates that there were significant increases in the number of Homeless from 2018 to 2019 in the states of&nbsp; New Mexico by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">27%</span>, California by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">16%</span>&nbsp;, Idaho&nbsp; by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">15%,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">and&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Virginia by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">12%</span>&nbsp;. However the data also shows&nbsp; no significant changes in Income ( increased by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">6%</span>&nbsp;in New Mexico, by 6<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">%</span>&nbsp;in California, by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">6%&nbsp;</span>in Idaho, and by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">4%</span>&nbsp;in West Virginia), in Population ( increased by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">0.28%</span>&nbsp;in New Mexico, by 0<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">%</span>&nbsp;in California, by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">2%&nbsp;</span>in Idaho, and&nbsp; decreased by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">-0.59%</span>&nbsp;in West Virginia), and there was no significant change in US inflation, which increased only by&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">3%</span>&nbsp;during that period. This implies that inflation, population or income did not have significant effect on the number of Homeless between states. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies Of&nbsp; Harvard University , the metropolitan areas with the largest increases in 2019 , all have particularly high-cost burdens and scarce affordable housing. Therefore, to solve the issue of these significant increases in number of homeless, I suggest the housing services need to address this lack of affordable housing by making housing affordable to most people, providing assistance to rent and moving costs.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><strong>Education</strong>&nbsp;: Based on to the data on the report, from the 5 year&nbsp; average of&nbsp; 544K homeless in the US,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">113K ( 21%)&nbsp;</span>were ages under 18. Completing high school is a contributing factor in whether youth will suffer from homelessness at some point in their lives. According to U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, children and youth who don’t earn a high school diploma are&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">346%</span>&nbsp;more likely to experience homelessness than those with a diploma. I suggest a school-based support for children who are living without a consistent home can help them develop the skills needed to become stable and independent, and rise out of homelessness. I also suggest&nbsp; state and federal grants fund programs that evaluate students’ needs and provide them with free education, transportation, immunization, proper enrollment, assistance with attendance, residency and proper guardianship.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><strong>Assistance to the Veterans :&nbsp;</strong>Based on to the data on the report, from the 5 year&nbsp; average of&nbsp; 544K homeless in the US,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">388K ( 70%)</span>&nbsp;were over the age of 24.&nbsp; According to the&nbsp; the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)<br>40,056 veterans are homeless on any given night and nearly&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">13% of the homeless adult population are veterans</span>. Veterans face a set of unique challenges when transitioning back into civilian life. The lack of affordable housing, unemployment and PTSD are all contributing factors, just to name a few. Veterans who struggle with homelessness often suffer from more than just living without a roof over their heads. Many experience recurring disorders and PTSD, and finding stability through housing addresses many of the obstacles veterans face to find treatment and live with stability. To decrease the number of veteran homelessness I suggest the following :&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><ul style="list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0.65em 0px 0.9em; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Offer permanent housing to as many Veterans and chronically homeless individuals as possible on a community level.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">A health care network of outpatient clinics, vet centers and VA hospitals for veterans.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Assist Veterans with technical skills and job placements, educational programs to be a productive part of society.</li></ul><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><br><bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIuZ2lkOi8vYmMzL0F0dGFjaG1lbnQvNDU2MjAyNTYwP2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--91711fdc3e7d7ab8250becfde613bac9e9acbf48" content-type="image/png" url="https://preview.3.basecamp.com/3945211/blobs/cf54c13c-b58e-11ed-80e2-e2462c7272c8/previews/full" href="https://storage.3.basecamp.com/3945211/blobs/cf54c13c-b58e-11ed-80e2-e2462c7272c8/download/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="1196202" width="975" height="721" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Suggestions"><br></bc-attachment></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1161/8/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIuZ2lkOi8vYmMzL0F0dGFjaG1lbnQvNDU2MjAyNTYwP2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--91711fdc3e7d7ab8250becfde613bac9e9acbf48" content-type="image/png" url="https://preview.3.basecamp.com/3945211/blobs/cf54c13c-b58e-11ed-80e2-e2462c7272c8/previews/full" href="https://storage.3.basecamp.com/3945211/blobs/cf54c13c-b58e-11ed-80e2-e2462c7272c8/download/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="1196202" width="975" height="721" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Suggestions"><br></bc-attachment></div>
